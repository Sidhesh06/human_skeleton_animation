# Human Skeleton Animation

This project is a fun and interactive web application that uses a live webcam feed to animate a human skeleton. The skeleton mimics the movements, facial expressions, and gestures of the person in front of the camera. It is built using Flask for the web interface, OpenCV for video processing, and MediaPipe for pose and face tracking.

## Features
- **Real-time Skeleton Animation:** Tracks and animates a human skeleton in real-time.
- **Facial Expressions and Gestures:** Mimics facial expressions and gestures using advanced facial and pose detection.
- **Interactive and Fun:** Add playful animations and effects for a humorous touch.
- **Web-Based Interface:** Access the application through a simple web browser.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A webcam
- Internet connection

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-skeleton-animation.git
cd human-skeleton-animation
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application
Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 4: Access the Application
Open a web browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Deployment

### Deploying to Render
1. Create an account at [Render](https://render.com/).
2. Create a new **Web Service** and connect it to your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the build and start commands:
   - **Build Command:**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Start Command:**
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
4. Deploy and wait for the service to go live.
5. Share the public URL with others to showcase your app!

## How It Works

1. **Webcam Input:** Captures live video feed using OpenCV.
2. **Pose and Face Detection:** Utilizes MediaPipe for detecting body and facial landmarks.
3. **Skeleton Drawing:** Overlays a human skeleton on the video feed based on the detected landmarks.
4. **Flask Interface:** Streams the processed video feed to the web browser.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AttributeError: `module 'mediapipe.python.solutions.face_mesh' has no attribute 'FACE_CONNECTIONS'`**
   - Update your `mediapipe` library to the latest version:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade mediapipe
     ```

2. **Webcam Not Working**
   - Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.

3. **Slow Performance**
   - Reduce the video frame size in `skeleton_tracker.py` for better performance:
     ```python
     cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
     cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)
     ```

## Future Improvements
- Add more playful skeleton animations and effects.
- Allow users to record and save animated videos.
- Support additional gestures for interactivity.
